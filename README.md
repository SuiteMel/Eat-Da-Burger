# Eat-Da-Burger

## Technology Used
* MySQL
* Node
* Express
* Handlebars
* Homemade ORM

## What The App Does
This app is simple in its use. You add a burger with the form and it shows up on the left. You can then choose to devour it and it will show up on the right side with all the other devoured burgers.

### Challenges
Keeping track of all the files was one of the most challenging parts in creating this application. I had to go back and make sure everything was linked correctly and keep track of all the associated variables and functions that relate to each other.

#### Future Implementations
* Clear the input field after submit
* Use bootstrap for cleaner looking styling
* Allow you to delete burgers
